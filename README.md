# Tailwind CSS Styles Not Applying Bug Report

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS styles fail to apply despite seemingly correct setup and usage. The issue appears to be related to the order of CSS files or some form of cascade interference.  The `bug.html` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.html` demonstrates a corrected version with an explanation of the fix.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in your browser. Observe that the Tailwind classes do not style the elements as expected.
3. Open `bugSolution.html` to see the corrected code and explanation. 

This bug highlights the importance of understanding CSS specificity and the order in which stylesheets are loaded in a web page.  Ensure your Tailwind directives are correctly placed and that there are no conflicting styles present.
