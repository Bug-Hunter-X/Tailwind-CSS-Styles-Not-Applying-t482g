The issue was resolved by ensuring that the Tailwind CSS stylesheet was loaded *after* any other potentially conflicting CSS files.  In the original `bug.html`, another stylesheet was included before the Tailwind stylesheet, overriding some of the Tailwind classes. Moving the Tailwind CSS link to be *after* all other CSS links fixed the problem.  Additionally, checking for overly specific selectors in other CSS files that might accidentally override the Tailwind classes is crucial.  If selectors are too specific, they may override the Tailwind classes regardless of loading order. To improve readability and maintainability, using utility-first approach with Tailwind and avoid writing custom CSS whenever possible is recommended.
